Hello! Welcome to the README of this project I did for my PP(Personal Project). It took me approximatelly 4 months to complete this project. I learned how machine learning works, how LLMs work and generally how they think. And learned how to use Google Cloud and specifically VertexAI and DiscoveryEngine


About the Study_Buddy:

It is a Multi-Agent system, divided into 2: 1 is the so called "Theory Agent" which handles the theory and gives the appropiate theory for the user query (Developed with VertexAI and has approximately over 2000 pages of Mathematical Theory spanning from Highschool to University, Algebra & Geomtry)
2 is the "Creative Agent" which is basically Gemini handling the Theory and giving a customised response like a human. It reads the theory and responds accordingly. It can answer any type of query regarding math, doesn't hallucinate and you can do follow-up questions.

DISCLAIMER!
It doesn't work on github due to the necessity of it being uploaded via Docker and on Cloud. Sadly I do not have the time needed for this so I am just going to leave the code open for anyone!
